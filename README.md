# Polymer Experiments

It`s all about the [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/). The plarform provides Web Components features using polyfills nowadays. There are html import, custom elements, pointer events, templates, shadow DOM and so forth.

I take a shot:

* to make some custom elements, using prebuild set of elements such as `polymer-ajax` or `polymer-animation`;
* to use core API, such as `Polymer` constructor with it's properties;
* to check data-binding features, use templates;
